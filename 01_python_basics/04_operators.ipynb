    "# Python Operators\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, **operators** are special symbols or keywords that perform operations on variables and values. Python supports a wide range of operators that can be categorized based on the type of operation they perform.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of Python Operators:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Arithmetic Operators**:\n",
    "   Used to perform mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, etc.\n",
    "   - `+` : Addition (e.g., `x + y`)\n",
    "   - `-` : Subtraction (e.g., `x - y`)\n",
    "   - `*` : Multiplication (e.g., `x * y`)\n",
    "   - `/` : Division (e.g., `x / y`)\n",
    "   - `%` : Modulus (returns remainder) (e.g., `x % y`)\n",
    "   - `**` : Exponentiation (e.g., `x ** y` raises `x` to the power of `y`)\n",
    "   - `//` : Floor division (e.g., `x // y` returns the quotient rounded down)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Comparison (Relational) Operators**:\n",
    "   Used to compare two values and return a boolean (`True` or `False`).\n",
    "   - `==` : Equal to (e.g., `x == y`)\n",
    "   - `!=` : Not equal to (e.g., `x != y`)\n",
    "   - `>` : Greater than (e.g., `x > y`)\n",
    "   - `<` : Less than (e.g., `x < y`)\n",
    "   - `>=` : Greater than or equal to (e.g., `x >= y`)\n",
    "   - `<=` : Less than or equal to (e.g., `x <= y`)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Logical Operators**:\n",
    "   Used to combine conditional statements or compare boolean values.\n",
    "   - `and` : Returns `True` if both operands are `True` (e.g., `x and y`)\n",
    "   - `or` : Returns `True` if at least one operand is `True` (e.g., `x or y`)\n",
    "   - `not` : Returns the opposite boolean value (e.g., `not x`)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Assignment Operators**:\n",
    "   Used to assign values to variables.\n",
    "   - `=` : Assigns value (e.g., `x = 10`)\n",
    "   - `+=` : Adds and assigns (e.g., `x += 5` is the same as `x = x + 5`)\n",
    "   - `-=` : Subtracts and assigns (e.g., `x -= 5`)\n",
    "   - `*=` : Multiplies and assigns (e.g., `x *= 3`)\n",
    "   - `/=` : Divides and assigns (e.g., `x /= 2`)\n",
    "   - `%=` : Modulus and assigns (e.g., `x %= 3`)\n",
    "   - `**=` : Exponentiation and assigns (e.g., `x **= 2`)\n",
    "   - `//=` : Floor division and assigns (e.g., `x //= 2`)\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Bitwise Operators**:\n",
    "   Perform bit-level operations.\n",
    "   - `&` : Bitwise AND (e.g., `x & y`)\n",
    "   - `|` : Bitwise OR (e.g., `x | y`)\n",
    "   - `^` : Bitwise XOR (e.g., `x ^ y`)\n",
    "   - `~` : Bitwise NOT (e.g., `~x`)\n",
    "   - `<<` : Left shift (e.g., `x << 2`)\n",
    "   - `>>` : Right shift (e.g., `x >> 2`)\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Membership Operators**:\n",
    "   Used to test if a value is part of a sequence (such as a list, tuple, or string).\n",
    "   - `in` : Returns `True` if a value is present in the sequence (e.g., `x in y`)\n",
    "   - `not in` : Returns `True` if a value is not present in the sequence (e.g., `x not in y`)\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Identity Operators**:\n",
    "   Used to compare memory locations of two objects.\n",
    "   - `is` : Returns `True` if both variables refer to the same object (e.g., `x is y`)\n",
    "   - `is not` : Returns `True` if variables do not refer to the same object (e.g., `x is not y`)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Operator Precedence:\n",
    "Python operators follow a hierarchy when multiple operators are used in an expression, called **operator precedence**. For example, multiplication and division have higher precedence than addition and subtraction. Use parentheses `()` to control the precedence explicitly in expressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Example: Operator precedence\n",
    "x = 5 + 3 * 2  # Multiplies first, then adds\n",
    "y = (5 + 3) * 2  # Adds first due to parentheses, then multiplies\n",
    "\n",
    "print(x)  # Output: 11\n",
    "print(y)  # Output: 16\n"
