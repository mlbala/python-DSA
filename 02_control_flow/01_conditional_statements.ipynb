    "## What Are Control Statements?\n",
    "\n",
    "Control statements in Python are fundamental constructs that allow you to control the flow of execution in your program based on specific conditions. They enable decision-making, repetition, and conditional execution. By using control statements, you can guide your program to make decisions (using conditional statements like `if`), repeat actions (with loops like `for` and `while`), or alter the usual flow (using `break`, `continue`, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of Control Statements:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Conditional Statements**: These statements allow the program to make decisions based on conditions (e.g., `if`, `if-else`, `if-elif-else`).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Loops**: These statements repeat a block of code multiple times based on a condition (e.g., `for`, `while`).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Control Flow Alteration**: These are special statements that can alter the usual flow within loops (e.g., `break`, `continue`, `pass`).\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, control statements allow for more dynamic and flexible code execution, which is essential for handling various real-world scenarios.\n"

    "### `if` Statement Example\n",
    "\n",
    "The `if` statement allows you to execute a block of code only if a certain condition is true. If the condition evaluates to `False`, the block is skipped, and the program continues.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "score = 85\n",
    "\n",
    "if score >= 80:\n",
    "    print(\"You passed the test!\")\n"

    "### `else` Statement Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "The `else` statement is used to define a block of code that will execute when the condition in the corresponding `if` statement evaluates to `False`. It provides an alternative path in the code, ensuring that something happens when the `if` condition is not met.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `else` block must follow an `if` statement, and no conditions are placed on `else` itselfâ€”it runs when the previous conditions are not met.\n",

    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "score = 65\n",

    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",

    "### Nested Conditional Statements\n",
    "\n",
    "Nested conditional statements are conditionals placed inside other conditionals. This means you can have an `if`, `else`, or `elif` block inside another `if` or `else` block. It allows you to check multiple conditions in a hierarchical or dependent manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is useful when you need to make a decision inside another decision. Each level of the nested statement must be properly indented to show that one block belongs to another.\n",

    "```python\n",
    "age = 20\n",
